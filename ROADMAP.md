# Roadmap — Wondershot (formerly grabbit)

_Last updated: 2026-06-06_

## Working today (v0.1.x)

**Capture & library**
- Region/fullscreen capture (Spectacle backend, portal fallback)
- Carousel gallery over multiple watched folders (Screenshots +
  ~/Videos/Screencasts), drag-out to any app, skeleton thumbs, rename,
  trash, pin-on-top, settings dialog, tray, single-instance CLI
- Hotkey via KDE custom shortcut → `wondershot --capture`
  (`grabbit --capture` still works as a legacy alias)

**Editor**
- Arrows, lines, boxes, ellipses, pen, highlighter, text (click label /
  drag box with wrap width), step numbers, live pixelate, crop,
  cut-out V/H
- Objects are layers: select with any tool, move, corner grips,
  rotate grip (smooth, Shift = 15° snap, curved-arrow cursor),
  text width/font grips, step radius grip
- Grip edits and adds/deletes are undoable; properties sidebar
  (color/stroke/text size) applies to selection
- Sidecar persistence: library images reopen with annotations as live
  objects (`<library>/.wondershot/<name>.json` + `<name>.base.<N>.png`
  stack, N=0 = original); destructive ops (crop/cut-out/bg-remove) are
  undoable on revisit; autosave on close/switch/quit — no save prompts
  for library files (kept for files opened from outside the library)

**Video**
- Smooth playback (QVideoWidget; frozen-frame overlay while editing —
  Wayland's video subsurface can't be painted over, so we hide it and
  paint the frame ourselves)
- Range blur: boxes on a paused frame, per-blur time spans on the
  timeline bar (edge grips / move / scrub-while-dragging), multiple
  regions, one ffmpeg pass → `-redacted.mp4`; renders isolated in
  `.rendering/` so half-written files never hit the gallery
- GIF conversion (animates + loops in player, GIF badge)
- Video sidecars: not yet — videos have no annotation objects (range
  blur renders to a new file). Sidecars for video arrive together with
  video annotation objects.

**Recorder (native, no Spectacle)**
- Portal ScreenCast → PipeWire → gst-launch: x264 + AAC mp4 into the
  library; source picker shown on every recording (fresh pick — a
  stored restore_token used to skip it after first use, which meant
  you could never change the recorded screen/window; fixed 2026-06-07)
- Microphone with measured tuning: webrtcdsp NS very-high, AGC off
  (ambient floor −43dB vs −21dB raw); device picker + toggles in
  Settings; full log at ~/.cache/wondershot/recorder.log
- Camera bubble: circular, frameless, always-on-top, drag to move,
  wheel to resize, bottom-right default via KWin window rule;
  toolbar + tray toggle

## Awaiting Jack's verification

- [ ] Recording audio: voice level OK with AGC off? (if too quiet:
      add fixed makeup gain, not AGC)
- [ ] Bubble lands above the taskbar on first open (96px clearance,
      300ms rule-reload delay)
- [x] Stop button sync — **CONFIRMED BROKEN 2026-06-07**: clicking Stop
      in the tray does not stop the recording. Moved to bug backlog below.
- [ ] Recording survives past the first seconds (videorate fix for the
      pipewiresrc no-PTS mux abort) and stop always resolves — the
      watchdog now reports pipeline death instead of "Stopping" forever
- [ ] OneDrive end-to-end: Connect → browser sign-in lands; share a
      shot and a video, link opens. Azure SAS untested against a real
      account (built to spec)

**Wondershot rename (2026-06-06)**
- Package/CLI/config renamed; settings auto-migrate from grabbit;
  `grabbit` CLI alias kept so existing KDE hotkeys still fire
- Old `~/.local/share/grabbit/venv` deleted 2026-06-07 (Jack's call),
  along with `~/.config/grabbit` (settings were migrated at first
  wondershot run)
- 2026-06-07: Jack's Alt+% capture shortcut was still bound to the
  pre-rename `net.local.grabbit.desktop` service id — the deleted file's
  cached entry launched the ORPHANED venv's old binary, whose
  single-instance socket name (`grabbit-<uid>`) no longer matches the
  running app (`wondershot-<uid>`), so the shortcut died whenever the
  app was already open. Fixed with a NoDisplay compatibility shim at
  `~/.local/share/applications/net.local.grabbit.desktop` exec'ing the
  new binary (KGlobalAccel config deliberately untouched — landmine).
  `wondershot --install-desktop` should write this shim too so other
  pre-rename users heal automatically.

**Sharing — three providers, one Share button**
- Single Share button, top-right of the gallery's main toolbar (same
  spot for images and videos; acts on the selected item). Confirms on
  the button itself: Uploading… → ✓ Copied link; dialog on failure
- S3-compatible + Azure Blob: stdlib HMAC signers (SigV4 verified
  against AWS's test vector + live MinIO); time-limited presigned/SAS
  URLs; caret menu picks provider + sets default
- OneDrive/SharePoint via Graph (stdlib): browser-redirect sign-in
  (auth-code + PKCE over the `wondershot://auth` scheme handler, no
  secret) with a "Use device code" checkbox fallback; Connect↔Cancel↔
  Disconnect; inline destination (My OneDrive / search a SharePoint
  site → library); client ID hidden as "Wondershot Built-In" w/ Change.
  Public-client toggle on the app registration is confirmed ON.
- Credentials note: S3/Azure keys are plaintext in config; OneDrive
  uses refresh tokens in a 0600 cache instead

**Editor & capture UX**
- Snagit-style zoom: fit-to-window default (tracks window resize, never
  upscales small images); status-bar − / zoom-% combo / + / Fit
- Effects: rounded corners + bottom fade (properties panel, persisted
  defaults). Live preview over a checkerboard mat + padding so the
  transparency reads; applied once, mat excluded at flatten
- Snagit-style capture window (Capture button in gallery toolbar):
  big red Capture + full screen/record, toggles for preview/clipboard/
  cursor/delay that persist as defaults
- Editor toolbar is tools-only (file ops via shortcuts + context menu)
- Deletes are undoable: hover (x) on cards (confirms), Ctrl+Z restores
  from a staging dir, flushed to system trash on quit
- Arrows/lines show endpoint grips only (no dashed box); properties
  panel rows follow the selection; "Camera" replaces "Bubble"

## Snagit-parity workstreams (2026-06-06)

Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-snagit-parity-design.md`.
A/B/C are mutually independent; D gates scroll/step capture; E comes
after Linux is feature-complete.

**WS-A — Video quick wins** _(in progress)_
- Capture frame from video (S): ffmpeg single-frame extract — avoids
  the QVideoSink/Wayland subsurface landmine
- Trim (S/M): reuse the blur range timeline; stream-copy default,
  frame-accurate re-encode checkbox; middle-cut/concat → backlog
- Cursor halo (M): **investigated 2026-06-06, parked.** Portal cursor-mode
  *metadata* (4) delivers pointer coordinates as PipeWire `spa_meta_cursor`
  per-buffer stream metadata — but our recorder is a `gst-launch-1.0` argv
  subprocess, and `pipewiresrc` (1.4.11 — zero "cursor" strings in the
  compiled plugin) does not translate that metadata into anything a
  downstream element in a pipeline string can read, so there is nowhere to
  composite a halo. (Probe transcript: `spikes/cursor_halo_probe.md` —
  AvailableCursorModes=7, gst-inspect of pipewiresrc, binary grep; a
  metadata-mode test recording — expected to show the cursor vanish with no
  recoverable coordinates — is written up there as a manual check.)
  Unblocking requires owning the pipeline in-process (appsink/appsrc, or a
  pw_stream consumer) so we can read `spa_meta_cursor` per buffer and draw
  the halo ourselves — that rewrite is the same frame-source seam WS-D's
  scroll capture needs, so the halo rides along with WS-D rather than
  blocking WS-A. Until then, recordings keep cursor-mode *embedded* (2).
  Click *animation* remains gated on WS-D input capture.
- Pause/resume (M): **investigated 2026-06-07, parked.** gst-launch argv
  subprocesses have no runtime control channel — no PAUSED state, no
  valve property flips. SIGSTOP/SIGCONT freezes the process but not the
  pipeline clock: do-timestamp'd buffers jump PTS across the gap, and
  the videorate element (the no-PTS landmine fix) backfills the entire
  pause with duplicated frames to keep CFR — silently wrong output
  (probe transcript: spikes/pause_resume_probe.md). Clean pause needs
  owning the pipeline in-process (gst python bindings / appsink) with
  valves ahead of the mux and accumulated-offset PTS rewriting — the
  same frame-source seam as the cursor halo and WS-D scroll capture;
  pause/resume rides along with that rewrite.
- Region-only recording (M): out of scope for now. The portal ScreenCast
  source types are monitor|window (record.py SelectSources `types: 3`) —
  there is no region source on Wayland. A fixed crop *could* be injected
  at launch time (`videocrop` after videoconvert in _gst_args, with a
  region picked by the existing region selector before the portal dance),
  but mid-recording region changes and DPI/multi-monitor mapping need the
  same in-process pipeline rewrite as pause/resume and the cursor halo.
  Design crop-in-pipeline alongside that seam; do not bolt onto gst-launch.

**WS-B — AI foundation** _(shipped; Jack verified 2026-06-07: "they work okay")_
- BYO OpenAI-compatible endpoint: `ai_endpoint`/`ai_api_key`/`ai_model`
  settings, AI tab, stdlib-HTTP `aiclient.py`, QRunnable jobs
- AI redaction (M): tesseract word boxes (optional dep) + LLM picks
  *which* text is sensitive → PixelateItems, non-destructive
- Background remover (M): local ONNX (rembg) as `wondershot[ai-local]`
  extra — chat endpoints can't return alpha mattes, so never the LLM
- Image simplifier (L): SHIPPED (batch 4) — vision LLM → editable
  RectItems (Snagit-better: objects, not flattened); reuses redaction's
  vision→regions pipeline
- AI robustness (2026-06-07, from Jack's Simplify failures): reply
  parsing survives prose-wrapped, object-wrapped (`{"regions":[...]}`),
  and markdown-list-of-objects replies (scrape every balanced `{...}`);
  `max_tokens` raised 1024->4096 (full-screen lists were truncating);
  honest "reply was cut off" error when a model still overflows; AI
  actions show an inline busy bar (toolbar<->canvas) instead of a delayed
  modal — instant, non-modal feedback

**WS-C — Capture UX** _(done 2026-06-07)_
- Post-capture quick-action toolbar: DONE — frameless always-on-top bar
  (KWin position rule, bubble precedent) with Edit/Copy/Save-as/Share/
  Trash/dismiss on the just-captured file; auto-dismiss setting
  (default 8 s), Esc dismisses; shown only when the gallery isn't
  brought forward.
- Auto-size-to-window: DONE — KDE-only via KWin scripting D-Bus
  (`kwin.py`: script injected via loadScript, geometry returned as one
  string to a registered slot, hard timeouts, feature-probe hides the
  mode off-KDE); fullscreen capture cropped to the active window's
  frame, multi-monitor + HiDPI aware. Trivial on X11/Win/mac later;
  GNOME needs an extension — documented, not built.

**WS-D — Capture engine** _(spike in progress)_
- Scroll capture (XL): user scrolls, we stitch — frames from the
  existing ScreenCast pipeline through a portable FrameSource seam,
  numpy overlap-matching stitcher. No input injection needed.
- Step capture (XL): blocked on global click observation. Linux path:
  xdg InputCapture portal (spike running; findings below). If the
  spike fails, step capture ships Windows-first under WS-E.
  AI halves (auto-crop around click, write instructions) are S each
  once WS-B's client exists.
- Click animation in video (M): same input gate as step capture

**WS-E — Cross-platform (Windows, then macOS)**
- Qt UI ports free; per-OS work = CaptureManager/ScreenRecorder
  backends, hotkeys, packaging. Windows first (Snagit-refugee
  audience; step capture trivial via SetWindowsHookEx).
- Windows dev/test against the win11 VM over SSH — no separate box
- Deferred decisions: packaging tool (PyInstaller vs briefcase),
  GStreamer-on-Windows vs native encode, code signing, keyring

### WS-E Windows backends — SHIPPED 2026-06-07 (branch session/win-port)
What landed (behind sys.platform factories; Linux byte-identical):
- `wincapture.py` — `WinCaptureManager` (mss fullscreen grab, ctypes
  GetForegroundWindow + DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS active-window
  geometry, owned frameless `RegionOverlay`); CaptureManager contract.
- `winrecord.py` — `WinScreenRecorder` (ffmpeg ddagrab→gdigrab fallback,
  dshow mic, QProcess q-stop/terminate/kill ladder, watchdog, salvage).
- `hotkey.py` — `WinHotkeyBackend` (RegisterHotKey message loop on a
  QThread; default Ctrl+Shift+PrintScreen → region).
- Factories: `create_capture_manager`, `create_screen_recorder`,
  `window_capture_available`; portable `server_name()`; cursor toggle
  disabled on Windows.
Verified on win11-pam VM (real interactive desktop): app + tray launch,
hotkey fires the region overlay, region/fullscreen/active-window PNGs are
correct crops of real pixels, recording produces a playable h264 mp4.

Documented gaps / landmines:
- **ddagrab needs a D3D11 device** — the VM has no GPU D3D11VA, so
  `ddagrab` fails ("Failed to create D3D11VA device"). The recorder
  detects the candidate dying within `FALLBACK_WINDOW_S` (never produced
  footage) and **automatically relaunches gdigrab** — a runtime,
  death-triggered fallback (filter-presence probe alone can't predict
  D3D11 init). Verified end-to-end through the real create_screen_recorder
  path on the VM: h264 1280x800 mp4, no forced builder. A *later* death
  stays a real, salvaged failure. On GPU hardware ddagrab wins first try.
  (Added in response to code review — the originally-claimed fallback
  didn't exist; 4 regression tests now guard it.)
- **Mic** depends on dshow devices (VM has none → records video-only).
- **Scroll capture**: gated off on Windows (needs the WS-D FrameSource).
- VM toolchain note: staged `setuptools>=68` was required for
  `pip install -e` (VM shipped 65.5.0); also stage on fresh VMs.

### WS-E Windows parity backlog (Jack, 2026-06-07: gaps NOT acceptable)

These three shipped as v1 gaps but are Snagit table-stakes — committed
work, not accepted limitations:
- **Cursor in stills** (S/M): mss/BitBlt omits the cursor; composite it
  ourselves via ctypes `GetCursorInfo` + `DrawIconEx` onto the grabbed
  bitmap, honoring the existing cursor toggle (re-enable it on Windows).
- **Window picker** (M): Snagit-style hover-highlight + click-to-pick —
  `EnumWindows`/`WindowFromPoint` + highlight overlay; we already get
  exact bounds via DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS for the active window.
- **Hotkey rebinding** (S/M): `QKeySequenceEdit` row in Settings + Qt→
  win32 modifier mapping into the existing `RegisterHotKey` backend.
  (Linux stays manual-bind — KGlobalAccel landmine — Windows rebinds.)

### Packaging direction (decided 2026-06-07)

- **Windows**: PyInstaller one-dir → Inno Setup silent installer
  (`/VERYSILENT`) → winget manifest (`microsoft/winget-pkgs`); updates
  via `winget upgrade`. Blocker with lead time + cost: code signing
  (SmartScreen + winget moderation) — Azure Trusted Signing (~$10/mo)
  or an OV cert. Resolves the PyInstaller-vs-briefcase deferred call.
- **Linux now**: `curl | sh` installer script — check distro deps
  (python3-gobject, gstreamer pipewire plugin, ffmpeg), venv with
  `--system-site-packages`, pip install, run `--install-desktop`;
  self-update via re-running pip.
- **Linux end-state**: Flatpak on Flathub (auto-updates, portals are
  native to the sandbox). Costs: GStreamer/gi in the manifest, sandbox
  holes for ffmpeg/tesseract/KWin-scripting D-Bus.
- Implication: avoid compiled C extensions where ctypes works (cursor
  halo pw_stream reader, libei) — keeps every package pure-Python.

### InputCapture portal probe findings

_(pending — filled in by the WS-D spike)_

## Next up (in order)

1. **Sidecar persistence** — annotations stay editable objects when you
   revisit an image (Jack's "can't go back and edit objects";
   re-raised 2026-06-07: "still not seeing layers persist side-by-side
   with images/videos").
   Design: library file stays the flattened share-ready PNG; sidecar
   `.wondershot/<name>.json` + original base copy; editor reconstructs
   objects on load.
   Jack's bar (Snagit parity): do everything — including destructive-
   looking ops like background removal — with **no save prompts**, and
   undo them when you come back to the picture later. A dedicated
   own-format file is acceptable if needed ("not critical if we have
   to do that"). Implies: destructive ops (bg remove, flatten, AI
   redact once flattened) must store the pre-op base in the sidecar so
   revisit-undo works, and autosave replaces the save prompt.
2. **Recording polish** — countdown before start, region-only
   recording (portal already asks, but in-app choice), pause/resume,
   recording duration in tray tooltip.
3. **Editor backlog** — text alignment + edge snapping in boxes
   (Snagit), style-change undo, blur-tool variant, step renumbering,
   custom rotate cursor polish.
4. **Video backlog** — DONE 2026-06-07: blur strength spinbox (persisted,
   previewed live), GIF fps/max-width/time-range options reusing the trim
   span timeline (persisted defaults), frost rectangles preview the actual
   blur (QImage downscale/upscale approximation — render remains truth).
   (trim/cut moved to WS-A)

## Bugs & small UX (from Jack, 2026-06-07 — end of list per Jack)

- **Tray Stop doesn't stop the recording.** Toolbar stop works; the
  tray-menu Stop does nothing. Likely the tray action isn't wired to
  the same stop path post-refactor — reproduce, then fix both-ways
  sync (either control stops + both reset).
- **Minimize/hide our windows when capturing.** Capture should not
  have the editor or capture window sitting in the shot: hide/minimize
  editor + capture window (gallery already has a hide flow in app.py)
  before the screenshot fires, restore after. Wayland: minimize via
  Qt showMinimized is allowed even though positioning isn't.

## Cross-platform position

UI/editor/video/library are pure Qt (portable as-is). OS-specific code
is quarantined in CaptureManager + ScreenRecorder backends; Windows
(native APIs) and macOS (ScreenCaptureKit) become additional backends,
not rewrites. Electron evaluated and rejected: would forfeit native
drag-out, GPU video path, and tray-app footprint without reducing the
per-OS capture work. Prep rules while building A–D: OS-specific code
stays behind seams (CaptureManager/ScreenRecorder/FrameSource), one
ffmpeg helper with PATH discovery, binary discovery for tesseract,
HotkeyBackend interface, CI matrix on all three OSes.

## Platform landmines (hard-won, do not relearn)

- KGlobalAccel D-Bus: malformed `setShortcutKeys` aborts KWin 6.6.5
  (compositor crash). Report upstream; never auto-register.
- QtDBus signal connects need `SLOT("name(sig)")` — raw strings get
  their first char eaten and fail silently.
- xdg portals demand uint32-typed options; PySide6 can't produce typed
  variants → portal calls go through Gio/GLib (system gi module,
  venvs need --system-site-packages).
- Wayland: windows can't self-position (use KWin rules; no panel
  struts in availableGeometry); video lives in a native subsurface
  above all widget painting; translucent siblings don't composite
  over it.
- QGraphicsVideoItem = CPU paint (lags 60fps); QVideoWidget +
  QOpenGLWidget viewport = blank on Wayland.
- libx264 can't enter WebM containers; transcode webm→mp4 (+AAC).
- pipewiresrc intermittently emits buffers with no PTS near stream start
  (even with do-timestamp=true); mp4mux aborts the whole pipeline on the
  first one ("Buffer has no PTS"). videorate + fixed framerate caps drop
  them and yield CFR output. Watchdog the gst process for its whole
  life — a single startup liveness check misses later death and the UI
  hangs on "Stopping".
- QListView uniformItemSizes caches the first measurement — set
  explicit sizeHints/placeholder icons before the view measures.
- Qt movable-drag moves all selected items with the grabber — freeze
  the parent while dragging child grips.

### In-process recorder (2026-06-07, branch session/recorder-inproc)

The Linux `ScreenRecorder` no longer shells out to `gst-launch-1.0 -e`;
`record.py` builds an in-process `Gst.parse_launch` pipeline driven by a
`GstBus`. Hard-won notes:

- The recorder still imports NO Gst directly. All Gst lives behind
  `_GstPipeline` (the only `_gst()` caller) and the `_make_pipeline` seam;
  decision logic is pure module functions (`build_pipeline_description`,
  `elapsed_seconds`, `crop_props`, `halo_geometry`, `pts_offset_ns`), so
  the behavioral suite runs headless against a `FakePipeline`.
- Lifecycle: `send_eos()` (bus EOS) finalizes the mp4; bus `ERROR` is the
  death signal (watchdog the whole life). `force_stop()` (set state NULL)
  replaces the double-SIGINT/SIGKILL escalation ladder when an EOS wait
  wedges. EOS takes a poll cycle to reach the bus, so the "Stopping…"
  window is naturally observable.
- The `videorate ! video/x-raw,format=I420,framerate=30/1` no-PTS fix is
  copied verbatim. The only structural addition is a transparent
  `identity name=pause` tap on the RAW side before `x264enc` (pause probe).
- Live smoke (`tests/test_record_live.py`, `importorskip("gi")`,
  videotestsrc, NO portal): EOS-finalizes-playable-mp4, cairooverlay draw
  callback fires in-process, and pause/resume continuity all pass on the
  dev box (GStreamer 1.26.11). CI without gi skips them.

### Region recording (in-process, D2) — SHIPPED with a v1 constraint

Tray "Record region…" + gallery toolbar "Record region" grab a fullscreen
still, show the existing `wincapture.RegionOverlay`, and on `selected` set
`recorder._crop = crop_props(...)` then start the normal recording; the
crop is applied in-pipeline (`videocrop` after `videoconvert`). The portal
still streams the whole monitor — we crop downstream. `_crop` is per-
session (reset in `_cleanup`) so a later full-screen recording is uncropped.

Deviations from the plan:
- The plan said `grab_fullscreen` is "portable Qt via QGuiApplication"; in
  reality `wincapture.grab_fullscreen` uses `mss` (the Windows extra, not
  installed on the Linux dev venv). The grab is behind the `_region_grab`
  seam (overridden in tests) and only runs on a live desktop, so the suite
  doesn't need it; on Linux it will need `mss` (X11) or a Wayland-safe grab
  at runtime — flagged as a checklist item rather than wired here.
- Multi-monitor: crop coords are assumed to be in the same pixel space as
  the portal stream. v1 is correct for the primary/single-monitor case; a
  rect spanning the virtual desktop while the portal streams one monitor
  would be offset. Documented in the desktop checklist (item 16) for a
  follow-up; not solved here (needs a live multi-monitor portal session).

### Cursor halo (in-process) — PARKED (cursor source), wiring SHIPPED

Shipped: the `record_cursor_halo` setting + dialog row, `halo_geometry`
pure math, `cursor_mode=4` (METADATA) requested at SelectSources when halo
is on, the `videoconvert ! cairooverlay name=halo` pipeline segment, and
the draw-callback wiring (`_connect_halo`/`_draw_halo`). The live test
proves the cairooverlay `draw` signal fires in-process.

Parked: actually painting the halo at the live cursor position. The draw
callback is a no-op until `self._cursor_xy` is populated, and populating it
requires reading PipeWire's `spa_meta_cursor` off each buffer. With
`cursor_mode=METADATA` the pointer arrives as a separate SPA metadata blob,
NOT as a typed `GstMeta` exposed through PyGObject — there is no gi binding
to pull `(x,y)` from a `Gst.Buffer`'s PipeWire cursor meta. Confirming the
exact negotiated behavior needs a live portal session (prompts Jack's
desktop), so it is a desktop-checklist item. Until a gi-readable path
exists, halo compositing stays parked behind the (off-by-default) setting.

## WS-D capture-engine spike findings (2026-06-06)

_Template appended by the WS-D plan; fill in after running the two
spikes on the Fedora/KDE box. These results gate scroll capture's
productization and step capture's platform order (Linux-first vs
Windows-first as part of WS-E)._

### Scroll capture (`wondershot --scroll-spike`, stitch.py)

Run it (live KDE session, NOT offscreen), from the ws-d worktree:

```bash
cd /home/jack/GitHub/grabbit-wt/ws-d
.venv/bin/wondershot --scroll-spike
```

1. The portal screen-share picker appears (or is skipped if a restore
   token exists from prior recordings). Window-pick the browser for
   cleaner results than a full-screen cast.
2. Open a long page, wait for "Recording —" to print.
3. Scroll top-to-bottom slowly (one wheel notch every ~0.5 s).
4. Ctrl+C in the terminal; a `ScrollCapture_*.png` should land in the
   library dir (default `~/Pictures/Screenshots`).

- Stitched tall PNG produced from a real scrolled window: YES (ran
  2026-06-06) — pipeline works end to end, output quality fails
- Seam quality: **very jagged** — visible misaligned strips, so
  `detect_offset`'s single 64-row band match is not accurate enough on
  real content (likely confounds: smooth/kinetic scrolling between
  frames, font antialiasing differences, the band landing on uniform
  background with no texture to lock onto)
- **Window targeting wrong**: the capture did not track the window
  being scrolled (portal stream captured something other than the
  intended/active window). Needs investigation: restore-token reuse
  from prior recordings may skip the picker and reuse the previously
  shared source — the spike should request a fresh window pick
  (ignore `screencast_token`) so the user explicitly picks the window
  to scroll
- Verdict: **NEEDS algorithm work** — concept proven (portal→appsink→
  stitcher produces a tall PNG), productization needs (a) better
  matching: multi-band or full-overlap cross-correlation, subpixel/
  integer refinement, texture-aware band selection; (b) fresh source
  pick per scroll session; (c) seam blending. The FrameSource seam and
  test harness are sound — iterate on `detect_offset`/`ScrollStitcher`
  against captured real-frame fixtures, not just synthetic noise

### InputCapture portal (`spikes/inputcapture_probe.py`)

Run it (live KDE session; uses the system python for gi):

```bash
cd /home/jack/GitHub/grabbit-wt/ws-d
python3 spikes/inputcapture_probe.py
```

If a permission dialog appears, accept it. The probe never touches
KWin directly; worst case is a failed portal request. Copy the
`FINDING:` lines into the blanks below.

- Portal interface present: YES — version: 1
  _(pre-filled via non-interactive property read during plan
  execution; no session was created)_
- SupportedCapabilities: 7 (KEYBOARD|POINTER|TOUCHSCREEN) _(pre-filled,
  same property read)_
- CreateSession: OK (granted capabilities=3 = KEYBOARD|POINTER;
  touchscreen not granted) _(run 2026-06-06)_
- GetZones: OK — zones=[(2560,1440,3440,0), (3440,1440,0,0)]
  (both monitors reported)
- ConnectToEIS fd obtained: YES (fd=8)
- Pointer button events observed: NOT YET — no python libei bindings
  (snegg) installed, so the EI protocol handshake couldn't be spoken;
  raw read returned 20 bytes without a handshake (the EIS server
  talking first — expected for EI, the probe's "unexpected" warning is
  just its own conservatism)
- Blocking gaps: (1) need an EI client — snegg (python libei bindings)
  or ctypes against libei — to handshake and decode button events;
  (2) must verify capture *semantics*: InputCapture is designed to
  intercept (input stops reaching apps while a capture is active,
  normally triggered via pointer barriers + Enable). Step capture
  needs observe-without-stealing — either confirm events flow without
  Enable/barriers, or re-emit captured input instantly via the
  RemoteDesktop portal. This is the next spike question.
- **Verdict: step capture LINUX-VIABLE (provisional)** — every portal
  step succeeds end to end on Fedora 43/KDE: session granted,
  zones reported, EIS fd handed over. Remaining work is client-side
  (EI protocol library) plus the interception-semantics question
  above, not platform capability. Keep Windows-first as fallback only
  if the semantics check fails.
- Editor: text-box edge snapping (spec batch-4 Track 4a item) — deferred
  from the simplifier/editor-backlog track; needs a design call on what
  snaps to what.

### Track 4b findings (scroll UI + EI client)

- Scroll capture: PRODUCTIZED — "Scrolling capture" in the
  tray menu + capture panel, gated on gi/GStreamer/numpy availability
  (NOT KDE; portal ScreenCast is desktop-neutral). Fresh portal pick
  per session (stitch-v2 token hooks), frameless stop pill
  (compositor-placed), stitched PNG lands through the normal captured
  path (quick bar / preview / clipboard). ScrollCaptureController
  relays frames through a QObject slot, so Gst-streaming-thread
  delivery is queued — the spike's direct-connection caveat is
  retired for the product path. --scroll-spike kept as the debug
  harness (pinned by test). Tray entry doubles as the finish control
  while a scroll session runs.
- EI client: snegg is NOT on PyPI ("No matching distribution found
  for snegg", re-checked 2026-06-07 at execution time per Task 5), so no
  [stepcapture] extra;
  wondershot/ei.py is a stdlib-ctypes binding against the system
  libei.so.1 (RECEIVE path only: handshake + pointer-button events,
  values verified against libei 1.5.0). inputcapture_probe.py now
  does SetPointerBarriers + Enable and prints button events with
  timestamps via that binding. Interception semantics (do apps still
  get clicks while we observe?) = pending the final manual probe run;
  step-capture UI stays blocked on that verdict.
